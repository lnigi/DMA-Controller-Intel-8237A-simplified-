<h1>DMA Controller Intel 8237A simplified</h1>
I realized this Verilog implementation with my two colleagues Vittorio Sali and Francesco Interlandi as a project for the course in Architettura dei Calcolatori (Computer Architecture) we took in university in 2023.

<h2>What can I find in this repository?</h2>
The implementation of the device is not complete, as not all the functions described in the original datasheet were not realized. Details about missing features can be found in the PDF file.
<ul>
  <li>In the attached PDF (LANGUAGE: Italian) all the technical details about the implementation can be found.</li>
  <li>Verilog code: the actual implementation of the device that me and my colleagues wrote.</li>
  <li>Images: pictures of some example outputs of the Verilog code used in different working modes.</li>
</ul>
